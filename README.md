David's Interview - Take Home - July 2019

3rd Party libraries used:
**Bolts**: a collection of low-level libraries designed to make developing mobile apps easier. It makes organization of complex asynchronous code more manageable. A task is kind of like a JavaScript Promise, but available for iOS and Android.

**AFNetworking**: a networking library built on top of the Foundation URL Loading System, extending the powerful high-level networking abstractions built into Cocoa. It has a modular architecture with well-designed, feature-rich APIs.

**JSONModel**: allows rapid creation of smart data models. Automatic introspection of your model classes and JSON input drastically reduces the amount of code you have to write.

**MJRefresh**: an easy way to use pull-to-refresh with refresh footer to load next pages.

**Cosmos**: a UI control that shows a star rating in the iOS standard design.

**InitialsImageView**: a helpful UIImageView extension that generates letter initials as a placeholder for user profile images, with a randomized background color.
